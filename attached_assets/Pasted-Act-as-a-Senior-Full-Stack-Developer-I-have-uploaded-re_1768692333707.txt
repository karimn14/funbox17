Act as a Senior Full Stack Developer. I have uploaded reference images for the UI/UX. Build a gamified Learning Management System (LMS) specifically for special education students (Tunagrahita).

Tech Stack:

Framework: React + Vite
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Icons: Lucide React
Animations: Framer Motion (Crucial for the "playful" vibe) & canvas-confetti
Backend/DB: Supabase (Use supabase-js client)
Design System (Vibe):

Theme: Child-friendly, "Playful Learning".
Colors: Pastel palettes (Soft Blue background, Pink/Green/Orange cards) as seen in reference images.
Shapes: Large rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl corners for everything.
Typography: Large, readable, sans-serif fonts. High contrast.
Core Data Structure (Supabase Logic):

Table students: id, name, class_name, created_at.
Table modules: id, title, video_url (YouTube), category (Math, Language, etc).
Table quiz_results: id, student_id, module_id, score, stars_earned (1-3).
App Flow & Page Requirements:

Landing Page (Login):

Main Center: A friendly card asking for "Nama Lengkap" (Name) and "Kelas" (Class).
Action: A big "Mulai Belajar!" (Start Learning) button.
Logic: When clicked, query the students table.
IF student exists: Log them in and retrieve their ID.
IF NOT exists: INSERT them as a new student automatically, then log in. (Auto-registration).
Admin Access: A small, subtle "Admin" button in the top-right corner. Clicking it asks for a PIN (e.g., '1234') to enter the Admin Dashboard.
Student Dashboard:

Header: "Halo, [Student Name]!" with a fun avatar.
Main Content: Grid of Module Cards (Matematika, Bahasa, Sains, etc.).
Navigation: A button to view "Riwayat Belajar" (Learning History).
Module Detail (The Learning Flow):

Step 1: Video. Embed a YouTube video player. Large "Lanjut ke Kuis" (Next to Quiz) button appears below.
Step 2: Quiz Interface.
Display 1 question at a time (Total 5 questions).
Layout: Question on top, 4 Big Colored Buttons (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) for answers.
WebSerial Integration (IMPORTANT): Create a custom hook useWebSerial. For now, mock this hook to listen to keyboard presses (A, B, C, D) to simulate the hardware buttons.
Feedback: If correct -> Show "Bintang" animation + Happy Sound. If wrong -> Shake animation + "Try Again" sound.
Quiz Result:

Show Score (e.g., 80/100) and Stars (1-3 stars).
Trigger canvas-confetti effect.
Buttons: "Ulangi Modul" or "Kembali ke Menu".
Learning History:

A simple list showing which modules the student has completed and how many stars they earned.
Admin Dashboard (Protected):

Table view of all students.
Expand a student to see their quiz_results (scores per module).
Specific Instructions:

Use mockData for now if Supabase is not fully connected, but write the supabaseClient.js structure so I can plug in the API keys later.
Ensure the UI is responsive (mobile & tablet friendly).
Make sure buttons have a "pressed" effect (active:scale-95).
